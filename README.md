# Realtime-Chatting-Webapp
I have created this WebApp with the help of the resources available online. I have added the applications of this project and steps to run it on your device

# How This Web-App Works?
This is a Realtime Chatting Application that provides an interface for multiple user chatting at the same time with the help of the resources available online. The technologies used in making the application were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS. I used Socket.io module for a two-way connection between client and server. FrontEnd includes a navigation bar, Chat window and a form submit button for sending the messages. I used an audio file that gives a notification whenever the user gets a new message. The user is asked for his name whenever he tries to join the chat and rest of the people are made aware that (name) has joined the conversation. If a user leaves the chat, it informs all the other users that (name) has left the chat.

# Steps To Run This App
* In the CMD terminal, run *nodemon nodeServer/index.js*
* Install the extension 'live server' for Visual Studio Code. **Link** - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
* After the extension gets installed navigate to index.html and open it to edit.
* Open the index.html file with Live Server and an instance of the application will appear in the browser.
* Copy the URL from the address bar and open another instance in another tab.
* Now you can chat using both the instances. You can create as many instances as you like.
